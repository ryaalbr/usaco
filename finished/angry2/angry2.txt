Angry Cows
==========

Bessie the cow has designed what she thinks will be the next big hit 
video game: "Angry Cows". The premise, which she believes is 
completely original, is that the player shoots cows with a slingshot 
into a one-dimensional scene consisting of a set of hay bales located 
at various points on a number line. Each cow lands with sufficient 
force to detonate the hay bales in close proximity to her landing 
site. The goal is to use a set of cows to detonate all the hay bales.

There are N hay bales located at distinct integer positions 
x1,x2,...,xN on the number line. If a cow is launched with power R 
landing at position x, this will causes a blast of "radius R", 
destroying all hay bales within the range x-R...x+R.

A total of K cows are available to shoot, each with the same power R. 
Please determine the minimum integer value of R such that it is 
possible to use the K cows to detonate every single hay bale in the 
scene.

PROBLEM NAME: angry

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input contains N (1 <= N <= 50,000) and K (1 <= K 
<= 10). The remaining N lines all contain integers x1...xN (each in 
the range 0...1,000,000,000).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Please output the minimum power R with which each cow must be 
launched in order to detonate all the hay bales.
